## Introduction

TAB is an open-source library designed for time series anomaly detection researchers.

We provide a clean codebase for end-to-end evaluation of time series anomaly detection models, comparing their performance with baseline algorithms under various evaluation strategies and metrics.

The below figure provides a visual overview of TAB's pipeline.

## Quickstart

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> this project is fully tested under python 3.8, it is recommended that you set the Python version to 3.8.

1. Installation:

Given a python environment (**note**: this project is fully tested under **python 3.8**), install the dependencies with the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Data preparation

Prepare Data. You can obtain the well pre-processed datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V5BAHWBKU8uih3hE1R7WdF6_crZlIbQT/view?usp=drive_link). Then place the downloaded data under the folder `./dataset`.  

3. Checkpoints preparation

You can download the checkpoints from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VKcv_sIPDJgSgzOxUIN80kAzqXdzhC0/view?usp=sharing). After obtaining the files, follow the steps below to organize them:
1. For LLM-based models, move the files from `checkpoints/llm_checkpoints` to the folder `ts_benchmark/baselines/LLM/checkpoints`.
2. For pre-train models (UniTS, Timer and TimesFM), move the files from `checkpoints/pre_train_checkpoints` to the folder `ts_benchmark/baselines/pre_train/checkpoints`. And the other models' checkpoints can be obtained from Huggingface by the code.


Ensure the files are placed in the correct directories for proper functionality.

4. Train and evaluate model

We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/multivariate_detection`, and `./scripts/univariate_detection`. For example, you can reproduce an experiment result as the following:

```shell
sh ./scripts/CATCH.sh
```



## FAQ

1. Is there code in TFB's code base to compute the characteristics of the dataset?

TFB has open-sourced the [code](https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB/blob/master/characteristics_extractor/Characteristics_Extractor.py) for computing time series characteristics, such as trend, seasonality, stationarity, shifting, transition, correlation, and more. Both [Chinese](https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB/blob/master/characteristics_extractor/Readme_chn.md) and [English](https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB/blob/master/characteristics_extractor/Readme_en.md) documentation are provided.
